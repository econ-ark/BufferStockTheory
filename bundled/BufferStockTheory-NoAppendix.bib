                   dynamics of heterogeneous-agent models where log
                   permanent income follows a random walk. The idea is
                   to simulate the model using a counterfactual
                   permanent-income-neutral measure which incorporates
                   the effect that permanent income shocks have on
                   macroeconomic aggregates. With the
                   permanent-income-neutral measure, one does not need
                   to keep track of the permanent-income distribution.
                   The permanent-income-neutral measure is both useful
                   for the analytical characterization of aggregate
                   consumption-savings behavior and for simulating
                   numerical models. Furthermore, it is trivial to
                   implement with a few lines of code.},
