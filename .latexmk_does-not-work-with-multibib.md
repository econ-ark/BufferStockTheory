# According to Claude:

Latexmk searches for a variety of commands in .tex files to determine dependencies and compilation requirements. Here are some of the key commands and elements it looks for:

Input and Include Commands:

\input
\include
\InputIfFileExists


Bibliography Commands:

\bibliography
\addbibresource (for biblatex)


Graphics and Figure Commands:

\includegraphics
\graphicspath


Index Commands:

\makeindex
\printindex


Glossary Commands:

\makeglossaries
\printglossaries


Package and Class Loading:

\usepackage
\documentclass


External File References:

\externaldocument (from the xr package)


Nomenclature:

\makenomenclature
\printnomenclature


Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables:

\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables


Custom Defined Dependencies:

You can define custom dependencies in your latexmkrc file


SyncTeX:

Checks for synctex=1 in the compiler options


Output Directory:

Checks for an output directory specification


LaTeX Engine:

Looks for commands or packages that might require a specific LaTeX engine (e.g., XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX)


Beamer-specific Commands:

When using the Beamer class for presentations


TikZ Externalization:

If TikZ externalization is used


Multibib Commands:

For documents using multiple bibliographies



This list is not exhaustive, and latexmk's behavior can be further customized through configuration files. The exact set of commands and features it looks for can also depend on the version of latexmk you're using, as newer versions often add support for additional LaTeX features and packages.
