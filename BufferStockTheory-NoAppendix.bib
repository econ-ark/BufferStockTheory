  abstract	= {I introduce a method for simulating aggregate dynamics of
		  heterogeneous-agent models where log permanent income
		  follows a random walk. The idea is to simulate the model
		  using a counterfactual permanent-income-neutral measure
		  which incorporates the effect that permanent income shocks
		  have on macroeconomic aggregates. With the
		  permanent-income-neutral measure, one does not need to keep
		  track of the permanent-income distribution. The
		  permanent-income-neutral measure is both useful for the
		  analytical characterization of aggregate
		  consumption-savings behavior and for simulating numerical
		  models. Furthermore, it is trivial to implement with a few
		  lines of code.}
